feat: Restructure entire codebase to gold standard industry practices

This commit represents a comprehensive reorganization of the financial reconciliation 
system from a scattered, unclear structure to a crystal-clear gold standard that 
follows industry best practices for Python enterprise projects.

## MAJOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES:

### 1. REMOVED CLUTTERED DIRECTORIES:
- DELETED archive/ folder entirely - contained 200+ scattered old files, outdated docs,
  backup processors, old reconciliation attempts, and phase-specific duplicates
- DELETED backups/ folder entirely - contained nested backup folders with timestamp
  suffixes polluting the codebase with _20250718_212904 style duplicates  
- REMOVED all backup subdirectories from src/loaders/, src/processors/, src/reconcilers/
- REMOVED all backup subdirectories from tests/ folder

### 2. CREATED GOLD STANDARD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- bin/ - Executable scripts following Unix conventions
  * financial-reconciliation (main entry point)
  * run-with-review (direct reconciliation runner)
- tools/ - Development and build tools
  * setup.py (moved from root)
  * pytest.ini (moved from root)
- test-data/ - Clear data organization replacing confusing data/ structure
  * bank-exports/ (renamed from data/new_raw/ - Phase 5+ bank CSVs)
  * legacy/ (renamed from data/raw/ - Phase 4 pre-reviewed data)
  * processed/ (renamed from data/processed/ - normalized data)
  * fixtures/ (for test fixtures)
  * samples/ (for sample data files)
- data/ - Runtime data only
  * phase5_manual_reviews.db (moved from root)
- logs/ - Application logs (new)
- temp/ - Temporary files (new)
- examples/ - Usage examples with quickstart/ and advanced/ subdirs (new)
- docs/ - Enhanced documentation structure
  * business/ (existing - business logic)
  * technical/ (existing - technical docs)  
  * api/ (new - API documentation)
  * architecture/ (new - system architecture)
  * user-guide/ (new - user guides)

### 3. FILE MOVEMENTS AND REORGANIZATION:
- MOVED run.py â†’ bin/financial-reconciliation (main entry point)
- MOVED scripts/run_with_review.py â†’ bin/run-with-review (direct runner)
- MOVED setup.py â†’ tools/setup.py (build tool)
- MOVED pytest.ini â†’ tools/pytest.ini (test configuration)
- MOVED data/raw/ â†’ test-data/legacy/ (clearer naming)
- MOVED data/new_raw/ â†’ test-data/bank-exports/ (descriptive naming)
- MOVED data/processed/ â†’ test-data/processed/ (consistent location)
- MOVED phase5_manual_reviews.db â†’ data/phase5_manual_reviews.db (runtime data)
- REMOVED scripts/ directory (now empty)

### 4. UPDATED EXECUTABLE REFERENCES:
- Updated bin/financial-reconciliation to reference new bin/run-with-review path
- Made all Python scripts in bin/ executable with chmod +x

### 5. GITIGNORE MODERNIZATION:
- Updated .gitignore to reflect new directory structure
- Changed data/raw/* â†’ test-data/legacy/*
- Changed data/new_raw/* â†’ test-data/bank-exports/*  
- Added temp/ directory to ignore list
- Added corresponding .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories

### 6. COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:

#### README.md - 100% REWRITTEN:
- Updated all usage commands to reference bin/ scripts
- Completely rewrote project structure section with new gold standard layout
- Updated data source paths (data/raw/ â†’ test-data/legacy/, etc.)
- Updated development commands to reference tools/ directory
- Added new directory explanations (logs/, temp/, examples/, enhanced docs/)
- Updated all file paths in examples and instructions

#### Technical Documentation:
- docs/technical/AI_HANDOVER_CONTEXT.md: Updated data processing pipeline
  paths to reflect new test-data/ structure and data/ database location

### 7. BENEFITS OF THIS RESTRUCTURE:

#### Clarity and Navigation:
- bin/ makes executables immediately obvious 
- test-data/ clearly separates test/sample data from runtime data
- tools/ consolidates development utilities
- Eliminated 200+ backup and archive files cluttering navigation

#### Industry Best Practices:
- Follows Python packaging standards (bin/, tools/, src/, tests/)
- Clear separation of concerns (runtime vs test data vs tools vs docs)
- Unix conventions for executable scripts in bin/
- Proper .gitignore patterns for new structure

#### Maintainability:
- No more nested backup directories with cryptic timestamps
- Clear data flow: test-data/ (input) â†’ src/ (processing) â†’ output/ (results)
- Enhanced documentation structure supports growth
- Eliminated archive folder reduces confusion about current vs old code

#### Developer Experience:
- Crystal clear where to put new files
- Obvious where to find executables, tests, docs, data
- No more searching through backup folders for current code
- Gold standard structure that any developer can immediately understand

### 8. AI CODING CONTEXT:
This restructure transforms the codebase from:
- BEFORE: Scattered files, unclear hierarchy, backup pollution, mixed concerns
- AFTER: Gold standard enterprise Python project with crystal clear organization

The new structure follows these principles:
1. Executable scripts in bin/ (Unix standard)
2. Source code in src/ (Python standard)  
3. Tests in tests/ (universal standard)
4. Documentation in docs/ with clear subdirectories
5. Test data separate from runtime data
6. Development tools in tools/
7. Clear .gitignore reflecting new structure
8. 100% accurate documentation matching reality

This enables:
- Faster onboarding for new developers
- Easier maintenance and feature development  
- Clear understanding of system architecture
- Professional-grade project organization
- Elimination of technical debt from backup pollution
