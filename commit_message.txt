feat: Implement Phase 5A reconciliation processor for Sept 30 - Oct 18, 2024

Phase 5A bridges the gap between Phase 4 (ending Sept 30) and the planned
Phase 5 reconciliation (Oct 2024 - July 2025). This 18-day period serves
as a critical checkpoint for the financial reconciliation system.

Key Implementation Details:
- Starting balance: $1,577.08 (Jordyn owes Ryan from Phase 4)
- Ending balance: $4,807.93 (Ryan owes Jordyn) 
- Balance swing: $3,230.85 in Jordyn's favor over 18 days

Processing Statistics:
- Total transactions: 203 loaded from 4 data sources
- Successfully processed: 196 transactions
- Manual review needed: 7 transactions (missing amounts due to encoding)
- Rent payments detected: 0 (likely in manual review)
- Zelle transfers detected: 0 (likely in manual review)
- Shared expenses: 176 transactions

Technical Fixes Applied:
1. Fixed accounting engine integration (post_expense, post_rent, post_settlement)
2. Corrected description decoder method calls (decode_transaction)
3. Added null amount handling for Chase bank encoding issues
4. Implemented proper share calculation based on decoder actions
5. Added comprehensive error handling and audit trail

Known Issues:
- 7 Chase transactions have unparseable amounts (encoding issue with ï¿½ character)
- Important transactions like "San Palmas Web Payment" (rent) are affected
- The large balance swing suggests missing rent/Zelle transactions
- Manual review and data correction will be needed

Files Added/Modified:
- phase5a_processor_fixed.py: Main processor with verbose documentation
- phase5a_loader.py: Data loader for the 18-day period (existing)
- output/phase5a/: Contains all generated reports and audit trails

This implementation provides a foundation for Phase 5 but requires
review due to the unexpected balance swing and missing transactions.
