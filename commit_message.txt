fix: Document expense data timeline and investigate date anomalies

## Investigation Summary

Discovered that expense history has potential data quality issues:
- Expense data appears to end around September 28, 2024
- Rent payments continue through December 2025 (as expected)
- This creates an 8-month gap where only rent is being tracked

## Key Findings

1. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - Last valid expense: September 28, 2024
   - Rent continues: Through December 2025
   - Gap: October 2024 - December 2025 (15 months)

2. **Data Quality Concerns**:
   - User reports expense data should only go to October 1, 2024
   - Some transactions after row 1474 may have incorrect dates
   - Source CSV appears to have corrupted/out-of-order entries at the end
   - Mix of backdated loan payments and duplicate Zelle transfers

3. **Impact on Final Balance**:
   - 8+ months of rent with no offsetting expenses
   - Each month ~$931 rent obligation for Ryan
   - This explains why Ryan owes Jordyn (no expenses to offset rent)

## Files Modified

- Added investigation notes and findings
- Documented data quality issues for future reference
- No changes to calculation logic (pending further review)

## Next Steps

1. Review source CSV for data corruption after row 1474
2. Validate expense dates after September 2024
3. Consider reprocessing with cleaned data
4. Verify if October-December 2024 expenses are missing or misdated

The current result (Ryan owes Jordyn $3,199.27) may need adjustment
once data quality issues are resolved.
