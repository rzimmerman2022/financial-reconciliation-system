fix: Critical balance calculation bug in Phase 5A audit + comprehensive analysis

CRITICAL BUG FIXED:
- Fixed double-entry bookkeeping violation in phase5a_comprehensive_audit.py
- Bug caused identical balance calculations regardless of payer
- Impact: $6,759.16 error over 18 days (Sept 30 - Oct 18, 2024)
- Jordyn's debt incorrectly showed as $8,336.24 instead of ~$1,577.08

ROOT CAUSE:
Both branches of the payer logic had:
  balance_change = jordyn_share - ryan_share
This violated fundamental accounting principles where debits must equal credits.

CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION:
- When Ryan pays: balance_change = -jordyn_share (Jordyn owes more)
- When Jordyn pays: balance_change = +ryan_share (Jordyn owes less)

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
1. Identified 5 major issue categories:
   - Mathematical error in balance calculation (PRIMARY)
   - Transaction categorization failures (86% miscategorized)
   - Data quality issues (7 missing amounts)
   - Pattern matching deficiencies
   - Lack of validation controls

2. Created detailed analysis report following GAAP standards
3. Added extensive inline documentation explaining the bug and fix
4. Documented best practices and recommendations

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
- 0 of 11 Zelle transfers properly detected
- ~$5,500 personal transactions incorrectly split 50/50
- Critical rent payment data missing/incorrect
- System has duplicate reconciliation implementations

Files modified:
- phase5a_comprehensive_audit.py: Fixed bug + verbose documentation
- FINANCIAL_RECONCILIATION_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md: Complete analysis report

This fix ensures the audit tool now matches the correct accounting
engine implementation in phase5a_processor.py.
