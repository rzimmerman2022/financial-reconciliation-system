feat: Add comprehensive audit trail generator for Phase 5A with critical findings

Implemented a forensic-level audit trail generator that revealed significant
issues in the Phase 5A reconciliation (Sept 30 - Oct 18, 2024).

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- Jordyn's debt INCREASED from $1,577.08 to $8,336.24 (!)
- Balance swing: $6,759.16 MORE debt in just 18 days
- This is a major red flag requiring immediate review

Key Issues Discovered:
1. Missing Amounts (7 transactions):
   - "San Palmas Web Payment" - likely rent payment with no amount
   - "Zelle Payment to Mom" - missing amount
   - Multiple autopay transactions - encoding errors from Chase

2. Incorrect Transaction Processing:
   - $600 rent payment from RYAN (should be from Jordyn per rules)
   - Only 1 rent payment detected (expected 1-2 for this period)
   - 0 Zelle transfers detected (loader found 11 potential)

3. Data Quality Issues:
   - Chase bank files have encoding problems (ï¿½ character)
   - 175 transactions categorized as expenses (seems high)
   - Possible miscategorization of rent/Zelle as expenses

Audit Trail Outputs:
- PHASE5A_COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_TRAIL.csv: Complete 204-row transaction log
  * Every transaction with source file and row number
  * Detailed share calculations and reasoning
  * Running balance after each transaction
  * Manual review flags with explanations

- PHASE5A_AUDIT_REPORT.txt: Human-readable findings
  * 8 transactions requiring manual review
  * Significant balance changes highlighted
  * Critical errors clearly documented

- PHASE5A_AUDIT_SUMMARY.json: Statistical summary
  * Category breakdown: 175 expenses, 1 rent, 0 Zelle
  * 8 manual review items
  * Balance progression tracking

The audit trail includes extensive inline documentation explaining:
- Business rule violations (rent paid by wrong person)
- Calculation methodology for balance changes
- Pattern matching logic for categorization
- Specific issues found in the data

This comprehensive audit provides the transparency needed to identify
and correct the significant discrepancies in the Phase 5A reconciliation.
