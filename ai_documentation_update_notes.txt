## DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY:
This update follows the principle of "Documentation as Code" where:

2. Documentation accuracy is paramount
3. Documentation structure mirrors code structure
4. Documentation serves multiple audiences

The financial reconciliation system now has documentation that is:
- 100% accurate to the current implementation
- Organized following the same gold standard as the code
- Comprehensive for users, developers, and maintainers
- Ready for future enhancements and growth
