# Current Status and Critical Issues
**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Last Commit:** c61ded4 - Full 2024 reconciliation revealing baseline discrepancy

## Executive Summary

We've discovered a **$16,438.27 discrepancy** in the Phase 4 baseline that we've been using as our "ground truth". This finding calls into question all subsequent reconciliations and requires immediate investigation.

## What We Just Did

### 1. Created Two Reconciliation Approaches
- **full_2024_reconciliation.py**: Processes ALL transactions from scratch using the upgraded algorithm
- **full_2024_reconciliation_enhanced.py**: Uses the Phase 4 baseline ($1,577.08) and continues from there

### 2. Discovered Major Discrepancies

#### Enhanced Reconciliation (with Phase 4 baseline):
- **Started with**: $1,577.08 (Jordyn owes Ryan) - the "official" Phase 4 ending
- **Phase 4 recalculated**: $18,015.35 (Jordyn owes Ryan) 
- **WARNING**: $16,438.27 difference from expected baseline!
- **Final balance**: $8,189.68 (Jordyn owes Ryan)

#### Full Reconciliation (from scratch):
- **Started with**: $0.00
- **Final balance**: $20,713.23 (Ryan owes Jordyn) - OPPOSITE DIRECTION!
- **Issues**: 109 transactions with missing amounts due to encoding errors

## Critical Problems Identified

### 1. Phase 4 Baseline Appears Incorrect
The $1,577.08 baseline we've been using differs by $16,438.27 from what the enhanced algorithm calculates. This suggests:
- Original Phase 4 had calculation errors
- Consolidated expense history may be incomplete
- Manual annotations weren't properly processed

### 2. Balance Direction Conflict
- Enhanced approach: Jordyn owes Ryan $8,189.68
- Full approach: Ryan owes Jordyn $20,713.23
- These are in OPPOSITE directions with a ~$29,000 difference!

### 3. Data Quality Issues
- **109 transactions** from Jordyn's Chase account have missing amounts
- Unicode replacement character (ï¿½) preventing parsing
- Examples:
  - San Palmas Web Payment (likely rent ~$2,121.36)
  - Yardi Service Charge (~$0.95)
  - Progressive Insurance (~$111.01)
  - Multiple ATM withdrawals and fees

### 4. Missing Data
- Jordyn's Chase data ends March 13, 2025 (missing 4+ months)
- Some rent payments not detected in categorization
- Potential gaps in early 2024 coverage

## Data Sources Being Used

### Ryan's Data:
1. **Monarch Money**: Sept 18, 2022 - July 18, 2025 (primary)
2. **Rocket Money**: Sept 15, 2022 - July 20, 2025 (secondary)

### Jordyn's Data:
1. **Chase Bank**: Dec 15, 2023 - March 13, 2025 (has encoding errors)
2. **Wells Fargo**: April 17, 2024 - Dec 31, 2025
3. **Discover**: Limited transactions

### Consolidated Data:
- **Expense History**: Through June 22, 2025 (has manual annotations)
- **Rent Allocation**: Through May 27, 2025
- **Zelle Payments**: Final version available

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Compare line-by-line Phase 4 calculations between old and new methods
- [ ] Identify which transactions cause the $16,438.27 discrepancy
- [ ] Determine why balance directions are opposite

### 2. Fix Data Quality
- [ ] Repair the 109 encoding errors in Chase data
- [ ] Manually input missing transaction amounts
- [ ] Validate rent payment detection

### 3. Obtain Missing Data
- [ ] Get Jordyn's Chase data for March 14 - July 2025
- [ ] Verify no other accounts are missing

### 4. Reconcile the Reconciliations
- [ ] Determine which calculation method is correct
- [ ] Establish new verified baseline
- [ ] Re-run all subsequent phases with correct baseline

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Why does the Phase 4 baseline differ by $16,438.27?**
   - Calculation error in original Phase 4?
   - Missing transactions in consolidated data?
   - Incorrect processing of manual annotations?

2. **Why do the two approaches show opposite balance directions?**
   - Different handling of transaction types?
   - Rent payment allocation differences?
   - Income vs expense categorization issues?

3. **What is the TRUE balance as of Oct 31, 2024?**
   - Need to resolve discrepancies first
   - Fix encoding errors
   - Validate all transaction categorizations

## Technical Details

### Files Created:
- `full_2024_reconciliation.py` - Full processing from scratch
- `full_2024_reconciliation_enhanced.py` - Uses Phase 4 baseline
- `output/full_2024_reconciliation/` - Results from scratch
- `output/full_2024_enhanced/` - Results with baseline

### Key Differences in Approaches:
1. **Enhanced**: Trusts Phase 4, processes Oct data only
2. **Full**: Ignores Phase 4, processes everything fresh

### Warning Signs in Logs:
- "WARNING: Phase 4 balance mismatch! Difference: $16438.27"
- Multiple "Could not convert to Decimal" errors
- Date parsing failures in consolidated data

## Conclusion

We have uncovered a fundamental issue with our baseline calculations that must be resolved before proceeding. The $16,438.27 discrepancy and opposite balance directions indicate significant calculation or data issues that affect the entire reconciliation project.

**Priority**: Investigate and resolve the Phase 4 baseline discrepancy before any further reconciliation work.
