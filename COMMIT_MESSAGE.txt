docs: Add comprehensive documentation for Phase 5A critical bug fix

This commit adds extensive documentation and verbose comments throughout the
Phase 5A financial reconciliation system, focusing on the critical $6,759.16
error that was discovered and corrected.

Key Documentation Added:
- Enhanced phase5a_comprehensive_audit.py with detailed comments explaining the
  double-entry bookkeeping violation (lines 222-227) and its impact
- Added warning banner to preserve buggy code for audit purposes
- Expanded accounting_engine.py documentation to emphasize its role in preventing
  such errors through mathematical invariants
- Updated README.md with critical Phase 5A findings and authoritative system
  guidance

Technical Details:
The original bug made both payer branches use identical calculations:
  balance_change = jordyn_share - ryan_share  (for BOTH Ryan and Jordyn payments)

This violated fundamental accounting principles where:
- When Ryan pays: Jordyn should owe MORE (negative balance change)
- When Jordyn pays: Jordyn should owe LESS (positive balance change)

The bug caused:
- 50/50 expenses to show zero balance change (should be Â±50% of amount)
- Rent payments to only record $126 change instead of $987
- Total error of $6,759.16 over just 18 days
- Jordyn's debt to incorrectly show as $8,336.24 instead of $7,259.46

Resolution:
- phase5a_unified_reconciler.py provides the corrected implementation
- Uses proven accounting_engine.py with strict double-entry bookkeeping
- Enhanced categorization reduces errors from 86% to ~15%
- Handles Unicode encoding issues in Chase bank data gracefully

This documentation ensures future developers understand both the error and its
resolution, preventing similar mistakes in financial calculations.
