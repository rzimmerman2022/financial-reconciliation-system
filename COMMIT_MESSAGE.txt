docs: Add comprehensive documentation and verbose comments to Phase 5A reconciliation system

DETAILED CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
==================================

1. ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION IN phase5a_unified_reconciler.py:
   - Added extensive header documentation explaining the $6,759 error discovery
   - Documented all 5 key features with detailed explanations
   - Added verbose inline comments for every major method
   - Explained the mathematical principles behind each calculation
   - Documented data quality issues and their handling
   - Added version info: v1.0.0 - FINAL AUTHORITATIVE VERSION

2. ENHANCED DOCUMENTATION IN phase5a_processor.py:
   - Added comprehensive header explaining all fixes and improvements
   - Documented the import error fixes (AccountingEntry/EntryType/Account)
   - Explained the enhanced categorization logic that fixed 86% miscategorization
   - Added detailed comments on data quality handling for Chase encoding errors
   - Documented the mathematical accuracy improvements
   - Added version info: v2.0.0 - FIXED

3. KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS DOCUMENTED:
   - Original bug: Both payer branches used identical balance calculation
   - Impact: $6,759 error over just 18 days (Sept 30 - Oct 18, 2024)
   - Root cause: Violation of double-entry bookkeeping principles
   - Fix: Proper debit/credit logic with opposite signs for different payers
   - Data issues: 7 Chase transactions with Unicode ï¿½ character corruption
   - Pattern improvements: Expanded keywords for rent, Zelle, personal, income

4. CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES DOCUMENTED:
   - Jordyn ALWAYS pays rent upfront (43% Ryan / 57% Jordyn split)
   - "2x to calculate" means full reimbursement (NOT double amount)
   - Zelle from Joan Zimmerman are personal (not Ryan/Jordyn transfers)
   - Credit card payments are personal expenses (not shared)

5. RECONCILIATION RESULTS DOCUMENTED:
   - Starting: $1,577.08 (Jordyn owes Ryan) - Phase 4 verified baseline
   - Ending: $7,259.46 (Jordyn owes Ryan) - TRUE reconciliation
   - NOT the erroneous $8,336.24 from buggy audit tool
   - 196 transactions processed, 7 flagged for manual review

6. MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION DOCUMENTED:
   - All invariants maintained throughout processing
   - Double-entry bookkeeping enforced at every step
   - Net positions always sum to zero
   - Receivables and payables properly mirrored
   - No money created or destroyed in the system

This comprehensive documentation ensures future maintainers understand:
- Why the system was built (to fix the $6,759 error)
- How it works (double-entry bookkeeping with invariant checking)
- What issues it handles (encoding errors, miscategorization)
- The authoritative results it produces

The code now serves as both a working reconciliation system AND a 
detailed technical reference for financial reconciliation best practices.
