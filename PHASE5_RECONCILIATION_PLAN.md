# Phase 5 Reconciliation Plan: October 2024 - July 2025

## 🏆 BASELINE ESTABLISHED

**As of September 30, 2024: Jordyn owes Ryan $1,577.08**

This document outlines the gold standard process for reconciling the remaining period from October 1, 2024 through July 7, 2025.

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

### Goal
Extend the current reconciliation system to process an additional 9+ months of transactions, building on our proven foundation.

### Key Principles
1. **Incremental Processing** - Start from $1,577.08 baseline
2. **Data Standardization** - Unified format across all sources
3. **Maintain Business Rules** - Same logic that got us here
4. **Complete Transparency** - Full audit trail continuation

## 🗂️ Data Sources & Preparation

### Expected Data Sources

#### Ryan's Data (Aggregated)
- **Source**: Rocket Money / Monarch Money exports
- **Format**: Aggregated from multiple institutions
- **Required**: Oct 1, 2024 - July 7, 2025 transactions
- **Key Challenge**: Standardizing multi-institution formats

#### Jordyn's Data
- **Source**: Individual bank/card exports
- **Format**: CSV exports from her institutions
- **Required**: Oct 1, 2024 - July 7, 2025 transactions
- **Key Challenge**: Ensuring no duplicates with Ryan's data

#### Rent Data
- **Source**: Existing Consolidated_Rent_Allocation_20250527.csv
- **Status**: Already contains 2025 data (verified)
- **Required**: October 2024 - July 2025 entries
- **Note**: Maintain Jordyn pays full rent rule

#### Settlement Data
- **Source**: New Zelle/Venmo/transfer records
- **Format**: Transaction exports or manual log
- **Required**: All settlements Oct 2024 - July 2025
- **Note**: Track direction (who paid whom)

### Data Standardization Requirements

All CSVs must be standardized to include:
```csv
Date,Payer,Description,Amount,Category,Account,Source_Institution
```

### Pre-Processing Checklist

- [ ] Date format consistency (YYYY-MM-DD preferred)
- [ ] Amount format standardization (no $ signs, decimal points)
- [ ] Clear payer identification (Ryan/Jordyn)
- [ ] No duplicate transactions between sources
- [ ] Description field populated for all transactions
- [ ] Date range validation (Oct 1, 2024 - July 7, 2025)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 5A: Data Loader Extensions

#### New Loader Functions Needed

1. **load_ryan_aggregated()**
   ```python
   def load_ryan_aggregated(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Load aggregated transaction data from Rocket/Monarch export."""
       # Handle multi-institution format
       # Standardize column names
       # Ensure payer = 'Ryan' for all
       # Return standardized DataFrame
   ```

2. **load_jordyn_transactions_2024_2025()**
   ```python
   def load_jordyn_transactions_2024_2025(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Load Jordyn's transaction data for Oct 2024 - July 2025."""
       # Process her bank/card exports
       # Standardize format
       # Ensure payer = 'Jordyn' for all
       # Return standardized DataFrame
   ```

3. **load_settlements_2024_2025()**
   ```python
   def load_settlements_2024_2025(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
       """Load settlement transactions (Zelle/Venmo/etc)."""
       # Track who paid whom
       # Include settlement method
       # Return standardized DataFrame
   ```

### Phase 5B: Transaction Processor Updates

#### Configuration Updates

1. **Date Range Extension**
   ```python
   # Update in transaction_processor.py
   start_date = "2024-10-01"  # Continue from October 1
   end_date = "2025-07-07"     # Through July 7, 2025
   ```

2. **Baseline Integration**
   ```python
   # Start from established baseline
   initial_balance = Decimal("1577.08")  # Jordyn owes Ryan
   # Process new transactions from this starting point
   ```

3. **Combined Processing Mode**
   ```python
   # Option 1: Process 2024 + 2025 as one
   # Option 2: Process 2025 separately, then combine
   # Recommendation: Option 2 for clarity
   ```

### Phase 5C: Output Enhancements

#### New Output Files

1. **phase5_transactions_audit.csv**
   - Only Oct 1, 2024 - July 7, 2025 transactions
   - Shows impact on baseline

2. **combined_2024_2025_audit.csv**
   - Full period: Jan 1, 2024 - July 7, 2025
   - Complete reconciliation story

3. **phase5_summary.json**
   - Starting balance: $1,577.08
   - Ending balance: [To be determined]
   - Transaction counts by type
   - Verification metrics

## 📊 Business Rules Confirmation

### Existing Rules (Maintain)

1. **Rent Payments**
   - Jordyn pays 100% upfront
   - Ryan owes his percentage (43% or as specified)
   - Monthly processing

2. **Expense Splitting**
   - Default: 50/50 split
   - Full reimbursement patterns
   - Gift transactions
   - Personal expenses

3. **Description Patterns**
   - Continue using existing decoder
   - Add new patterns as discovered
   - Manual review for unclear items

### Potential New Patterns

- [ ] Subscription services (who pays, how to split)
- [ ] Travel expenses (if any)
- [ ] New settlement methods
- [ ] Changed living arrangements (if applicable)
