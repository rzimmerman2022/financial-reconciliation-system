# Issues Resolution Report
Generated: 2025-08-07

## Summary
All identified issues have been investigated and resolved where necessary.

## Resolved Issues

### 1. CSV Loader Validation Issues ✅
**Issue**: RentAllocationLoader and ZellePaymentsLoader never marked datasets as invalid when required columns were missing.
**Resolution**: Modified both loaders to set `is_valid = False` when:
- Required columns are missing
- Critical data quality issues are found
- Business logic validation fails

### 2. Subprocess Error Handling ✅
**Issue**: Entry script used `subprocess.call` which hides execution failures.
**Resolution**: Replaced with `subprocess.run` using:
- `check=True` for error propagation
- `capture_output=True` for proper output handling
- Exception handling with detailed error reporting

### 3. Data Validation Type Assumptions ✅
**Issue**: `validate_data_quality` assumed amount columns had object dtype.
**Resolution**: Enhanced to handle both object and numeric dtypes:
- Checks dtype before processing
- Converts to numeric using clean_currency when needed
- Handles all numeric columns regardless of type

### 4. Manual Review Lookup Keys ✅
**Issue**: Lookup keys weren't normalized, causing mismatches due to formatting differences.
**Resolution**: Added `_normalize_lookup_key` method that:
- Standardizes date format to YYYY-MM-DD
- Formats amounts to 2 decimal places
- Trims description whitespace

### 5. GUI Placeholder Methods ✅
**Issue**: Premium GUI had unimplemented placeholder methods.
**Resolution**: Implemented all placeholder methods:
- `toggle_theme`: Switches between light/dark themes
- `_slide_out/in`: Visual feedback animations
- `_slide_in_reverse`: Previous navigation animation

### 6. Export Audit Trail Serialization ✅
**Issue**: JSON serialization failed on Decimal values in audit trail.
**Resolution**: Modified `export_audit_trail` to:
- Convert current_balance tuple properly
- Serialize Decimal values as strings
- Maintain proper JSON structure

### 7. Eval Security Risk ✅
**Issue**: Used eval() for arithmetic expression evaluation.
**Resolution**: Replaced with AST-based parser:
- Uses `ast.parse` for safe parsing
- Only allows basic arithmetic operations
- No code execution risks

### 8. Module-Level Logging Configuration ✅
**Issue**: Libraries configured global logging, overriding application settings.
**Resolution**: Removed `logging.basicConfig` from module level:
- Kept only in main() functions for scripts
- Libraries now use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` only

### 9. Currency Precision Loss ✅
**Issue**: ExpenseProcessor._clean_currency returned float instead of Decimal.
**Resolution**: Changed to return Decimal:
- Maintains precision for financial calculations
- Consistent with rest of codebase
- Added proper imports

## Non-Issues Investigated

### Hard-coded Bank Export Paths
**Status**: Already resolved - no hard-coded paths found in current code.

### Grocery Merchant Regex
**Status**: Working correctly - `Fry\'s` is proper Python string escaping.

### Run-with-review Interactive Requirements
**Status**: By design - interactive mode is intentional for manual review workflow.

## Testing Recommendations

Run the following to verify all fixes:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_data_loader.py -v
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_loaders.py -v
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_accounting_engine.py -v
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Critical**: Subprocess error handling, Decimal serialization
- **High**: CSV validation, manual review lookups
- **Medium**: AST parser, logging configuration
- **Low**: GUI animations, currency precision

All issues have been resolved with backward compatibility maintained.
