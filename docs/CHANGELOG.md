## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 5.x to 6.0.0

The major changes in 6.0.0 are organizational and should not break existing functionality:

1. **Update File Paths**: If you have scripts referencing moved files, update paths:
   ```bash
   # Old path
   python reconcile_web.py
   
   # New path
   python src/web/reconcile_web.py
   ```

2. **Update Import Statements**: If importing moved modules:
   ```python
   # Old import
   from reconcile_web import app
   
   # New import
   from src.web.reconcile_web import app
   ```

3. **Archive Access**: Deprecated files are now in `archive/deprecated/` if you need to access them.

### Upgrading from 4.x to 5.0.0

GUI improvements should be backward compatible. New GUIs are available but existing ones still work.

1. **New Ultra-Premium GUI**: Try the new interface:
   ```bash
   python launch_ultra_premium_gui.py
   ```

2. **Configuration**: No configuration changes required.

### Upgrading from 3.x to 4.0.0

File structure changes require path updates:

1. **Update Script Paths**: Many scripts moved to `src/scripts/`
2. **Update Web Interface**: Web interface moved to `src/review/`
3. **Update Imports**: Import paths changed for reorganized modules
