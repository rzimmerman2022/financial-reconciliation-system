### üìä **ALGORITHMIC ANALYSIS QUESTIONS**

**For each major algorithm, analyze:**

1. **Time Complexity**
   - What's the Big O notation for current implementations?
   - Where are the O(n¬≤) operations that could be optimized?
   - Are there unnecessary nested loops?

2. **Space Complexity**
   - How much memory is used for processing 1,500+ records?
   - Are there memory leaks or inefficient data structures?
   - Could we use generators instead of loading all data?

3. **Business Logic Efficiency**
   - Are the regex patterns optimized for performance?
   - Could the calculation logic be vectorized?
   - Is the validation logic redundant anywhere?

### üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK**

**Evaluate each component against:**

1. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Does each class have one job?
   - Open/Closed: Can we extend without modifying?
   - Liskov Substitution: Are inheritance patterns correct?
   - Interface Segregation: Are interfaces focused?
   - Dependency Inversion: Do we depend on abstractions?

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Factory Pattern: For normalizer creation?
   - Strategy Pattern: For calculation types?
   - Observer Pattern: For audit logging?
   - Command Pattern: For operations?

3. **Enterprise Patterns**
   - Repository Pattern: For data access?
   - Unit of Work: For transaction management?
   - Service Layer: For business logic?
   - Domain Model: For business entities?

## SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION TARGETS

### üéØ **HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **pandas Performance Optimization**
   ```python
   # ANALYZE CURRENT PATTERNS LIKE:
   for idx, row in df.iterrows():  # SLOW - O(n)
       # Replace with vectorized operations
   
   # RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVES:
   df['new_col'] = df.apply(lambda x: func(x), axis=1)  # BETTER
   df['new_col'] = np.vectorize(func)(df['col'])       # BEST
   ```

2. **Regex Pattern Optimization**
   ```python
   # ANALYZE CURRENT REGEX USAGE:
   re.search(pattern, text)  # Inside loops
   
   # RECOMMEND COMPILED PATTERNS:
   COMPILED_PATTERN = re.compile(pattern)
   COMPILED_PATTERN.search(text)  # Much faster
   ```

3. **Memory Management**
   ```python
   # ANALYZE CURRENT DATA LOADING:
   df = pd.read_csv(file)  # Loads all at once
   
   # RECOMMEND CHUNKED PROCESSING:
   for chunk in pd.read_csv(file, chunksize=1000):
       process_chunk(chunk)
   ```

### üìà **ALGORITHMIC ENHANCEMENTS**

1. **Smart Calculation Engine**
   ```python
   # CURRENT: Manual pattern matching
   # ENHANCED: Rule-based engine with priority scoring
   
   class CalculationRule:
       priority: int
       pattern: str
       handler: callable
       confidence: float
   ```

2. **Efficient Validation Pipeline**
   ```python
   # CURRENT: Sequential validation
   # ENHANCED: Pipeline with early termination
   
   class ValidationPipeline:
       def validate(self, data):
           for validator in self.validators:
               if not validator.validate(data):
                   return ValidationResult(False, validator.error)
   ```

3. **Optimized Categorization**
   ```python
   # CURRENT: Multiple regex searches
   # ENHANCED: Trie-based pattern matching or ML classification
   
   class CategoryClassifier:
       def __init__(self):
           self.model = self.train_model()
       
       def classify(self, text):
           return self.model.predict([text])
   ```
