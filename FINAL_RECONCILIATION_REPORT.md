- Expense data becomes unreliable after September 30, 2024
- Some entries after row 1,474 have corrupted dates
- Mix of backdated entries and duplicate Zelle transfers

**Decision**: Process only transactions from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 to ensure data integrity and focus on the current year.
