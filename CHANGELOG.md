### üö® Critical Production Fixes
This release resolves critical production-breaking issues including settlement calculation errors and ensures 100% test success rate.

### ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Settlement Logic (CRITICAL)**: Fixed bi-directional payment processing in accounting engine
  - Correctly handles "Jordyn pays Ryan" when Ryan owes Jordyn (reduces Ryan's debt)
  - Correctly handles "Jordyn pays Ryan" when Jordyn owes Ryan (reduces Jordyn's debt)
  - Fixed $1,000 calculation error where settlements were increasing debt instead of reducing it

- **Personal Expense Processing**: Fixed handling of personal expenses with amount=0
  - Personal expenses are now correctly processed even when amount is 0
  - Fixed early return logic in `src/core/reconciliation_engine.py` that was skipping personal expense tracking
  - Personal expense counter now correctly increments for flagged transactions
  
- **Test Suite Repairs**: Fixed 5 failing tests achieving 100% pass rate
  - Updated loader tests to properly expect FileNotFoundError instead of empty DataFrames
  - Fixed gold standard reconciliation tests for settlement scenarios
  - Corrected test expectations for personal expense detection
  - All 102 unit tests now passing (100% success rate)
