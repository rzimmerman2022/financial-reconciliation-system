## [4.0.4] - 2025-08-07

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **Replaced eval() with AST-based parser**: Eliminated security risk in arithmetic expression evaluation by implementing a safe Abstract Syntax Tree parser that only allows basic mathematical operations

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **CSV Loader Validation**: Fixed critical issue where RentAllocationLoader and ZellePaymentsLoader failed to mark datasets as invalid when required columns were missing
- **Subprocess Error Handling**: Replaced subprocess.call with subprocess.run for proper error propagation and output capture
- **Manual Review Key Normalization**: Fixed transaction matching failures by implementing consistent key normalization for dates and amounts
- **Decimal Serialization**: Resolved JSON serialization errors in export_audit_trail by properly handling Decimal types
- **Currency Precision**: Fixed precision loss by using Decimal instead of float in ExpenseProcessor

### 🚀 Improvements
- **Data Validation Enhancement**: Improved validate_data_quality to handle both object and numeric column types dynamically
- **GUI Functionality**: Implemented previously placeholder methods for theme toggling and animations in premium GUI
- **Logging Configuration**: Removed module-level logging.basicConfig calls to prevent override of application settings
