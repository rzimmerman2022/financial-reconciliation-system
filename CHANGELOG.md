- **Web Interface Path Resolution**: Fixed Flask 500 errors
  - Added intelligent multi-path CSV file search
  - Web interface now works from any directory
  - Graceful handling of missing data files
  
- **Test Suite Assertions**: Fixed pandas NaN/NaT handling
  - Updated tests to use `pd.isna()` and `np.isnan()` instead of `== None`
  - Fixed 3 test failures related to currency and date parsing
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**: Added integration test coverage
  - Integration tests now run in GitHub Actions pipeline
  - Improved overall test coverage and reliability
